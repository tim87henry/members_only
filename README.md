An Express JS app to practice authentication.

Click on this link to open the app: https://hidden-plateau-63098.herokuapp.com/

This project was done as part of The Odin Project's Node JS curriculum (www.theodinproject.com). I used this app to learn authentication on express JS.

The app is a message board club. Casual users can only view all messages. Only members of the club, can view information about the messages and can delete messages (if they are admins). To become a member of the club you can use the secret password (forzamilan).


# Technology used
